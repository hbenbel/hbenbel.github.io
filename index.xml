      <description>Cocktail Party Problem Imagine being in a party. Like in every party, the music is loud and everyone is screaming. Nevertheless, you can hear (almost) clearly the person that you are talking with. This capacity to focus your attention on a conversation in a noisy environment is what the psychoacousticians call the cocktail party effect. This effect becomes a problem when the person is unable to focus its attention on a particular stimulus.</description>
