      <description>Introduction Image colorization is a two century old subject which was first tackled by photographers. As early as 1839, european photographers would hand-color monochrome photographs with a mixture of pigments and gum arabic. Although it emerged in Europe, the practice of image colorization gained tremendous popularity in Japan in the 1860s as it began to be considered as a refined art.
