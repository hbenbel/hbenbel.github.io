      <description>Introduction Human visual perception can be extremely limited compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. We see just a tiny part of the light spectrum and we can hardly perceive tiny movements thus missing potentially important information from our environment. In 2012, Hao-Yu Wu and his team published the paper Eulerian Video Magnification for Revealing Subtle Changes in the World containing a method that allows us to amplify colors and motions from a simple video to help us visualize imperceptible changes from the world around us.</description>

      <description>Introduction Image colorization is a two century old subject which was first tackled by photographers. As early as 1839, european photographers would hand-color monochrome photographs with a mixture of pigments and gum arabic. Although it emerged in Europe, the practice of image colorization gained tremendous popularity in Japan in the 1860s as it began to be considered as a refined art.
