    <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Hussem Ben Belgacem. I&rsquo;m 25 and I started programming at the age of 12. I&rsquo;m now a freshly graduated Computer Science Engineer. My speciality is Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence and I&rsquo;m also really confortable with Software Engineering.</p>
<p>I currently speak fluently French, English, C++ and Python. I also have notions in Arabic and German.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to play video games, watch movies/tv shows and I also like to play the guitar. I&rsquo;m also passionate about History and Space ðŸ“œ ðŸš€</p>
<h1 id="studies">Studies</h1>
<p>I got my High School Diploma with a specialization in Mathematics and a Biology/Geology minor in 2014. Being on the top 1% of my High School, I joined a <em>Classe PrÃ©paratoire aux Grandes<br>
Ã‰coles</em> which are elite schools that prepare for the entrance examination of the french engineering schools that are also called <em>Grandes<br>
Ã‰coles</em>. There, I took intensive courses in Mathematics, Physics and Engineering. After that, I joined the <em>Grande Ã‰cole</em> called <em>EPITA</em> that specialize in Computer Engineering. There, I received a project oriented education with a special emphasis on code quality and optimization. I worked on a lot of solo/group projects including creating: malloc in C, an ISO reader in C, stream management functions (fclose, fopen, &hellip;) in C, an infinite number calculator in C++, a Compiler for Andrew Apple&rsquo;s Tiger Language in C++, an AI to mine ressources in Minecaft in Java, a Tamagochi Game in C++, an AI to finish a virtual FormulaOne Circuit in C, a shell in C, a spellchecker in C++, a search engine in Python, etc.</p>
<p>For my last two years of studies I chose to specialize in Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence. During those specialization years I had the opportunity to work on my end-of-studies project with a company called IDEMIA which is the world leader in the Biometric domain. For my end-of-studies internship I joined the R&amp;D center of Siemens Healthineers based in Princeton (NJ, USA).</p>
<h1 id="experiences">Experiences</h1>
<h2 id="siemens-healthineers">Siemens Healthineers</h2>
<p>I joined Siemens Healthineers from May 2019 to July 2020.<br>
There I worked on Robust Left Heart Segmentation on 2D Ultrasound Images. My work was to research, development and help put in production a pipeline that segments heart chambers and then computes some metrics that are going to be used to assess the health of the patient. My work improved drastically the previous performances (up to 7 points in term of DICE score) and was subject of an Invention Disclosure. To accomplish this I used Python and PyTorch for model training/testing, data curation and automatic report generation and I used C++ to put into production the pipeline.
