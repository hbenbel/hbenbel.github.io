      <description>Introduction Human visual perception can be extremely limited compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. We don&amp;rsquo;t see the entire color spectrum and we can hardly perceive tiny movements thus missing potentially important information from our environment. In 2012, Hao-Yu Wu and his team pusblished the paper Eulerian Video Magnification for Revealing Subtle Changes in the World containing a method that allows us to amplify colors and motions from a simple video to help us visualize imperceptible changes from the world around us.</description>

      <description>Introduction Image colorization is a two century old subject which was first tackled by photographers. As early as 1839, european photographers would hand-color monochrome photographs with a mixture of pigments and gum arabic. Although it emerged in Europe, the practice of image colorization gained tremendous popularity in Japan in the 1860s as it began to be considered as a refined art.

      <description>Cocktail Party Problem Imagine being in a party. Like in every party, the music is loud and everyone is screaming. Nevertheless, you can hear (almost) clearly the person that you are talking with. This capacity to focus your attention on a conversation in a noisy environment is what the psychoacousticians call the cocktail party effect. This effect becomes a problem when the person is unable to focus its attention on a particular stimulus.</description>
